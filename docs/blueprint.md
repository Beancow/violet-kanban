# **App Name**: TaskFlow Kanban

## Core Features:

- Task Management: Create and manage tasks within a Kanban board interface, organizing them into columns representing different stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- Drag-and-Drop Interface: Implement drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between columns, visually updating their status.
- Authentication & API Limit: Provide user authentication to secure boards, with API key based authorization for board access, limiting requests per key to avoid abuse.
- Customizable API Limits: Allow users to define API request limits on a key basis.
- AI Task Prioritization: AI tool to suggest optimal task placement or prioritization based on task descriptions and deadlines.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Moderate blue (#5DADE2) to convey a sense of calm productivity and focus, steering clear of overly vibrant or distracting shades.
- Background color: Light blue (#EBF4FA), a desaturated variant of the primary, to keep the interface light and airy.
- Accent color: Purple (#A357DE), a somewhat brighter and more saturated hue analogous to the primary color. It creates a focal point without being overwhelming.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, consistent icons for task categories and actions.
- Clean, card-based layout for tasks with clear visual hierarchy.
- Subtle transitions and animations when dragging and dropping tasks.
