# Security & Vulnerability Reporting

We appreciate reports of security issues. To report a vulnerability or sensitive bug, please follow these guidelines so we can triage and respond quickly.

Contact
- Email: v@aviolet.dev

What to include
- A short description of the issue and the impact.
- Steps to reproduce (minimal repro preferred) and the environment (browser, OS, Firebase/emulator or production).
- Affected versions/commit(s) if known.
- Proof-of-concept (PoC) code or reproduction steps. Do not include real user credentials or private keys.

> Please do not publicly disclose the issue until we have had a chance to acknowledge and coordinate a fix.

Handling and timeline
- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and provide an estimated timeline for triage and remediation.
- We follow a responsible disclosure process. If coordination is needed (patch window, mitigation steps), we'll propose a plan and timeline.

Safe harbor
- We ask reporters to avoid privacy-infringing actions (for example, accessing or exfiltrating real user data). If proof requires data access, describe the steps we can run instead or work with us to reproduce safely.

Optional: encrypted reports
- If you prefer to send a report encrypted, include a note in the initial email and we'll provide a public key or secure channel.

No bounty implied
- This repository does not imply any bounty program; if a bounty program is later introduced we'll document it here.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.
